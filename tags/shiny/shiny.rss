		<description>&lt;p&gt; I was sitting in a datacentre in the arse end of nowhere the other day waiting for a machine to boot when I noticed that 4 drives were flashing their activity lights at the same time. The fact that these 4 drives were spread across 2 machines was really shiny. It meant that soemthing I had set up was obvioulsy working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Each machine had 2 mirrored disks using software raid which accounts for 2 drives in one machine flashing at the same time. What made all 4 drives flash at the same time was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drbd.org/&quot;&gt;drbd&lt;/a&gt; which is bascially network raid 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We are using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drbd.org/&quot;&gt;drbd&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://linux-ha.org/HeartbeatProgram&quot;&gt;heartbeat&lt;/a&gt; to provide a HA solution for our database needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Anyway it felt good to realise that soemthing I had setup had a physical means to show it is working. Although it has to be said it felt quite good when I could just yank the power out of a machine and have the database failover nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
