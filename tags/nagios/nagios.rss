		<description>&lt;p&gt;Early this morning I got alerts from several of our nagios installations saying they couldnt reach www.google.com. I logged into a production machine from my phone and cheked it was still talking to the internet properly. They went back to sleep with an inkling this maybe an issue with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldipv6launch.org/&quot;&gt;World IPv6 Launch&lt;/a&gt; day.&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;When I woke up refreshed and ready for action I went an investigated and it would seem that on our servers check_ping will default to resolving the AAAA record which isnt good when you dont have IPv6 connectivity. So the easy fix is to specify -4 to check ping. Although I&#39;m tempted to just remove the check since if the internet is that broken the alert cant be sent anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
