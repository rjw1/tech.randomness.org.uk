		<description>&lt;p&gt;If you dont know much about using and setting up cisco routers I humbly suggest you buy &lt;a href=&quot;http://nostarch.com/frameset.php?startat=cisco&quot;&gt;Cisco Routers for the Desperate&lt;/a&gt;. It was very useful this week when I set up a pair of 2811s with HSRP. I would tell you how but I think you should buy the book instead.&lt;/p&gt;
